# NOTE

As of [this commit](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/WidescreenFixesPack/commit/51cd110c623fc40f61c201237a14db7a38d5fc78) in the [WidescreenFixesPack](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/WidescreenFixesPack) repository, this code has been fully integrated and implemented for Underground, Underground 2 and Most Wanted (with MW supporting dynamic window resizing).

# NFS Underground - Proper Windowed Mode

This is a quickly thrown together hook to allow for a proper window mode configuration for NFS Underground.

I've taken most of the code from my own [UbiTMNTHax](https://github.com/xan1242/UbiTMNTHax) and applied it here to this game.

(Made in about 30mins or so.)

## Features

- Initial resolution is not 800x600 anymore, values from the Widescreen Fix are injected

- Proper window mode configuration - configure it any way you want; borderless, bordered, resizable

- Preemptive startup location - you can set where the window will start when you launch the game (e.g. for playing on second monitor)

## Requirements

- [ThirteenAG's Widescreen Fix for NFS Underground](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/WidescreenFixesPack)

- Visual C++ 2022 x86 Redistributable
